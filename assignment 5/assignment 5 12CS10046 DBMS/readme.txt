OK 
this is a 1 hr query so 
I am sorry I can't make it any fast
the size of the largest clique will be printed first
you can check it in the middle of the last execution 
after completion of the graph it will print done
and then you can wait for around 20 min 
ther will be a txt file with the name mysql.txt
which will give for an actor actor pair whether there is a path or not
and a table Separation will be created which contains all the pairs 
where there exist a path and length of the path
